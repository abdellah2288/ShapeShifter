# What is ShapeShifter ?
ShapeShifter is the circuit generator and scoring assistants used in the Circuit Jam 24 event. It incorporates everything so that even a puppy can operate it.
# Why is the code structured like that ?
I had less than 48 hours to write the whole thing and ensure it's bug free, give me a break.
# Why are paths hardcoded?
Sue me.
# Is this code reusable at all ?
I don't know you tell me.
# Where's the little camera thing that was on display the of the event?
OBS magic, has nothing to do with this software
